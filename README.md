# 5CollegeGraph
A scraper and interactive visualization of prerequisites in the 5 Colleges

The majority of this repo is intended for use on my website.  It contains 5 sub-directories, A,H,M,S, & U, each containing
interactive visualizations of the departments in the Five Colleges.
This repo also contains PriorCourses.json which contains all of the past course details since 2014, and FiveCollegeScraper.py,
a script which contains functions to export interactive visualization of the prerequisite networks within each department at each school.
